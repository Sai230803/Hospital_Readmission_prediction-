# Hospital_Readmission_prediction-
This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is likely to be **readmitted to the hospital** using machine learning techniques.   The goal is to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and improve post-discharge care.


The project demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline including **data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation**.
